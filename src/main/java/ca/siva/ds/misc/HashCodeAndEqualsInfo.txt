In Collection like hashmap and hashSet.
> HashCode is used in collection to identify the right bucket for placing/searching the element.
> Once the bucket is found, iterate the bucket to find the right element to update by using the equals method.

>Always override both equals and hashCode method. Failure to do so will impact all hash-based collections.
 As it breaks the below contract:
 1) Whenever hashcode is invoked twice on the same object, the value will always be same.
    The value need not be same from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application.
 2) if two objects are equal according to equals(object) method, then calling the hashcode method on each of the two
    objects must produce the same integer result.
 3) if two objects are unequal, it should return distinct value for each object.
